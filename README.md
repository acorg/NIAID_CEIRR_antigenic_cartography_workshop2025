# NIAID_CEIRR_antigenic_cartography_workshop2025
This repository contains all code for the NIAID CEIRR Training Program Antigenic Cartography Workshop July 9-10, 2025


## Before the workshop

We will be working with free software.

The workshop is run in R. Please make sure you have a working installation of R 
on your computer. Instructions for download and installation can be found 
on the official R website: https://cran.r-project.org

Make sure you install the correct R for your operating system.

To install the `ablandscapes` package, you need to have development tools installed for your operating system. Instructions 
are linked on the R page. Here are the instructions to install the tools for MacOS, XCode and gfortran are needed: https://mac.r-project.org/tools/ 

If installation issues occur, it is often because the R version and the development tools version do not match. We recommend 
installing the most recent version of both and updating R if necessary.

We also recommend installing RStudio as it provides an accessible user interface: https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/

Once you have both install, please open a session in RStudio and run the script `code/00_installation.R` to install all 
packages that we will be using throughout the workshop.

## During the workshop

The code for each session is in the `code` directory and numbered. We will provide working code but encourage 
participants to try each task by themselves.
