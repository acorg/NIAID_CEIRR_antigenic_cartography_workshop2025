# Mapping complex exposure histories with antibody landscapes

This script contains code to construct antibody landscapes on top of antigenic maps. We will be mainly working with simulated SARS-CoV-2 data. Much of the content was previously made available here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13471558

### Antigenic maps from single vs. multi exposure sera



```{r ag_maps}
single_map <- read.acmap(filename = file.path(here::here(), "data", "maps", "01_sars_cov_2_map.ace"))

```


Antibody landscapes show how immunity distributes across variants in an antigenic map. The cross-reactivity of sera is quantified by the landscape's slope. The steeper the slope, the more specific a serum, and vice versa. The underlying geometry of the antigenic map - one antigenic distance unit corresponds to one two-fold change of neutralization titers - means that single exposure sera, from which the map was built, have a landscape slope around 1 on the log2 scale: With each antigenic distance unit away from the cone apex, the titers decrease by one two-fold. The slopes of multi-exposure sera are much lower than the slopes of single exposure sera.

Multiple exposures are known to increase cross-reactivity. We here simulate the increase in cross-reactivity by reducing the titer fold changes based on values from the data by [RÃ¶ssler, Netzl, et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-35312-3). The slopes for multi-exposure sera in their data were between 0.4 (Pre-Omicron + BA.2 reinfection) and 0.8 (Vaccinated + Delta infection). We will simulate Delta reinfection by adjusting the Wu.1 infected single exposure samples to match the 0.8 log2-scale slope, and the BA.2 reinfection by adjusting the same samples with the log2-slope of 0.4.

```{r creating_multi_exposure_sera}
single_wu1 <- logtiterTable(single_map)[,grepl("Wu.1", colnames(titerTable(single_map)))]
single_table_dist <- tableDistances(single_map)[,grepl("Wu.1", colnames(titerTable(single_map)))]

delta_bt <- abs(sweep(0.8*apply(single_table_dist, c(1,2), as.numeric), MARGIN = 2, single_wu1[1,c(1:3)], `-`))
dimnames(delta_bt) <- dimnames(single_wu1)

ba2_reinf <- abs(sweep(0.4*apply(single_table_dist, c(1,2), as.numeric), MARGIN = 2, single_wu1[1,c(1:3)], `-`))
dimnames(ba2_reinf) <- dimnames(single_wu1)
```

```{r visualizing_multi_sera}

matrix_to_long <- function(current_matrix, sr_group){
  
  as.data.frame(current_matrix) %>%
    rownames_to_column(var = "ag_name") %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = colnames(current_matrix), names_to = "sr_name", values_to = "logtiter") %>%
    mutate(sr_group = sr_group,
           sr_facet = sr_name, 
           sr_name = paste0(sr_name, "_", sr_group)) -> data_long
  
  return(data_long)
}

            sr_name = paste0("GMT", sr_group),
            sr_facet = "GMT") %>%
  rbind(., titer_long) -> titer_long

lndscp_cols <- data.frame("Color" = c("#F87", "#00BFC4", "#C77CFF"),
                          row.names = unique(titer_long$sr_group))

```

Making maps from multi-exposure sera comes with multiple difficulties. **Most importantly, the assumption that antigenic differences between variant X and Y are inferable from the immune escape of variant Y in homologous serum X, and vice versa, does not apply to multi-exposures. Multiple exposures change the antibody composition of sera, but not the antigenic properties of virus variants. Maps from multiple exposure sera, therefore, do not map the underlying antigenic relationships, but map serum properties.**

A map from multiple exposures shows immune escape in these specific sera, therefore, distinct exposure histories should not be combined as they likely have different immune escape patterns. To illustrate the effect of multiple exposure cross-reactivity on an antigenic map, we construct maps for each of the serum groups shown above:

```{r}
wu1_single_map <- make.acmap(apply(single_wu1, 1:2, function(x)2^x*10))
delta_bt_map <- make.acmap(apply(delta_bt, 1:2, function(x)2^x*10))
ba2_reinf_map <- make.acmap(apply(ba2_reinf, 1:2, function(x)2^x*10))

# change colors and orientation
agFill(wu1_single_map) <- agFill(single_map)
agFill(delta_bt_map) <- agFill(single_map)
agFill(ba2_reinf_map) <- agFill(single_map)

wu1_single_map <- realignMap(wu1_single_map, single_map)
delta_bt_map <- realignMap(delta_bt_map, single_map)
ba2_reinf_map <- realignMap(ba2_reinf_map, single_map)

# get map limits
lims <- Racmacs:::mapPlotLims(single_map, sera = FALSE)
xlim_zoom <- lims$xlim
ylim_zoom <- lims$ylim
# plot it
```


```{r}
# Do plotting
par(mfrow = c(2, 3))

plot(wu1_single_map, fill.alpha = 0.9, plot_labels = FALSE, outline.alpha = 0.9, xlim = xlim_zoom, ylim = ylim_zoom + 0.5, grid.col = "#cfcfcf", grid.margin.col="#7d7d7d", plot_stress = TRUE)

plot(delta_bt_map, fill.alpha = 0.9, plot_labels = FALSE, outline.alpha = 0.9, xlim = xlim_zoom, ylim = ylim_zoom+0.5, grid.col = "#cfcfcf", grid.margin.col="#7d7d7d", plot_stress = TRUE)

plot(ba2_reinf_map, fill.alpha = 0.9, plot_labels = FALSE, outline.alpha = 0.9, xlim = xlim_zoom, ylim = ylim_zoom + 0.5, grid.col = "#cfcfcf", grid.margin.col="#7d7d7d",  plot_stress = TRUE)

plot(procrustesMap(wu1_single_map, wu1_single_map), fill.alpha = 0.9, plot_labels = FALSE, outline.alpha = 0.9, xlim = xlim_zoom, ylim = ylim_zoom + 0.5, grid.col = "#cfcfcf", grid.margin.col="#7d7d7d", plot_stress = TRUE)

plot(procrustesMap(delta_bt_map, wu1_single_map), fill.alpha = 0.9, plot_labels = FALSE, outline.alpha = 0.9, xlim = xlim_zoom, ylim = ylim_zoom+0.5, grid.col = "#cfcfcf", grid.margin.col="#7d7d7d", plot_stress = TRUE)

plot(procrustesMap(ba2_reinf_map, wu1_single_map), fill.alpha = 0.9, plot_labels = FALSE, outline.alpha = 0.9, xlim = xlim_zoom, ylim = ylim_zoom + 0.5, grid.col = "#cfcfcf", grid.margin.col="#7d7d7d", plot_stress = TRUE)

```

Given that map distances are based on fold changes from the maximum titer variant in a serum, making maps from cross-reactive multi-exposure sera condenses map and overshadows antigenic differences between variants. 

**Antibody landscapes are a better way to show how serum properties change while preserving the antigenic relationships in an antigenic map**. 

# Antibody landscapes

Antibody landscapes better represent multiple exposure sera.
Neutralization titers are mapped as a continuous surface above an
antigenic map: Titers against the respective variant are mapped above
the variant in a third dimension, the height representing the titer
magnitude, and connected through a surface, the slope of which indicates
the cross-reactivity. The smaller the slope, the more cross-reactive the
sample.

The description above focusses on antibody neutralization, not binding.
The landscape fitting approach remains the same, however.


In the single cone landscape approached used for modelling SARS-CoV-2 immunity, cone coordinates (x,
y) and cone heights (z) are fitted to titers per subject. The slope of
this cone is optimised over all subjects per serum group, assuming the
same decrease of neutralization across antigenic space. The cone slopes
indicate the breadth of neutralization titers. As immune history becomes
more complex, for example for influenza, a single cone approach does not
provide a good approach and a loess fit should be used (discussed later).

The likelihood of the parameters is evaluated based on the negative log-likelihood 
of obtaining the measured titer from a normal distribution with mean = predicted (fitted) 
titer and a set standard deviation.

Below, we will model the three examples from above on the full SARS-CoV-2 map.

## Single cone SARS-CoV-2 Antibody landscapes

We assume that the response pattern, i.e. the fold changes, is the same per serum group, which is why we fit a single slope per serum group. For single exposure serum groups that are used in the map construction, we expect the slope value 
to be close to 1, as one unit in the map corresponds to 1 two-fold dilution of neutralization titers. The slope gives 
the change in titers per antigenic unit. Individual sera can have higher or lower titers, so each cone height parameter and the cone coordinates are fitted independently.

Crucial for fitting antibody landscapes is that the antigen names in the titer table and in the map are the same.
An antigen in the titer table that is not present in the map will result in an Error message, such as: "The following antigens were not found in the map supplied:". 
The *transposed* raw titer table, not the logtitertable, with "<LOD" titers written as "<LOD" is given as input. Titers that are not measured should be passed as "*". The column names are the antigens, the row names are the sera to be measured. The table is passed as a matrix. The `error.sd` parameter determines the standard deviation of the normal distribution used to 
evaluate the likelihood of measuring titer x with the current parameter set. A lower `error.sd` 
forces the fit to match the measured data, potentially resulting in overfitting. The parameter 
should resemble the standard deviation of titer repeat measurements.
  

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # put plots back to original state

# create a list of titer tables. You can also fit each table independently
titertables <- list("Wu-1 infection" = titerTable(wu1_single_map), 
                    "Delta Breakthrough" = titerTable(delta_bt_map), 
                    "BA.2 reinfection" = titerTable(ba2_reinf_map))

# do the fit per serum group on base map
lndscp_fits <- lapply(titertables, function(titer_table){
  ablandscape.fit(
           titers = t(titer_table), #errors can occur if the titertable for one serum group contains only one sample (then this sample is passed as a vector rather than a matrix) and if all titers in a sample are <LOD/NA. The titers are fitted, not the logtiters. <LOD values are estimated, but if all values are <LOD there is too little data to estimate from
           bandwidth = 1, # only important for loess fit
           degree = 1, # only important for loess fit
           method = "cone",
           error.sd = 1,
           acmap = single_map,
           control = list(
             optimise.cone.slope = TRUE,
             optimise.cone.coords = TRUE
           )
         )
  
})
```


The `lndscp_fits` object stores information on each fit, such as the fitted slope, cone coordinates, 
cone heights, and residuals between fitted landscape titer and measured titer. We can compare the fitted landscape slope and our multi exposure adjustments of 0.4 and 0.8 for the BA.1 reinfected and Delta breakthrough infections serum groups:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
slopes <- lapply(lndscp_fits, function(x) x$cone$cone_slope)

slopes
```
The small variation from the expected values (1, 0.8, 0.4) can be explained by the fact that the base map contains other serum groups that determine the variants' positions. For example, if we use the Wu-1 only map from above as base map, we can see that the slopes match our input values:

```{r}
lndscp_fits_single <- lapply(titertables, function(titer_table){
  ablandscape.fit(
           titers = t(titer_table), #errors can occur if the titertable for one serum group contains only one sample (then this sample is passed as a vector rather than a matrix) and if all titers in a sample are <LOD/NA. The titers are fitted, not the logtiters. <LOD values are estimated, but if all values are <LOD there is too little data to estimate from
           bandwidth = 1, # only important for loess fit
           degree = 1, # only important for loess fit
           method = "cone",
           error.sd = 1,
           acmap = wu1_single_map,
           control = list(
             optimise.cone.slope = TRUE,
             optimise.cone.coords = TRUE
           )
         )
  
})

slopes <- lapply(lndscp_fits_single, function(x) x$cone$cone_slope)

slopes
```

### Plotting antibody landscapes

To visualise antibody landscapes, we use the [`r3js`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/r3js/index.html) package. Let's begin by plotting the base map:

```{r}
z_lims <- c(0,10)
axis_at <- seq(z_lims[1], z_lims[2],2)

# Setup plot
data3js <- ablandscapes:::lndscp3d_setup(
    xlim = lims$xlim,
    ylim = lims$ylim,
    zlim = z_lims,
    aspect.z = 0.5,
    options = list(
      lwd.grid =  0.05,
      sidegrid.lwd = 1,
      sidegrid.col = "grey40",
      sidegrid.at = list("z" = axis_at),
      zaxt = "log"
    ),
    show.axis = FALSE
  )

# Add basemap
data3js <- lndscp3d_map(
    data3js = data3js,
    fit = lndscp_fits[[1]],
    xlim = lims$xlim,
    ylim = lims$ylim,
    zlim = c(0, 10),
    show.map.sera = FALSE,
    options = list(
      opacity.basemap = 0.3
    )
  )

data3js
```


We can add titers to the plot like this:

```{r lndscp_gmts}
titer_long %>%
  filter(sr_facet == "GMT") %>%
  unique() -> gmt_data

gmt_single <- gmt_data %>%
  filter(sr_group == "Wu-1 infection")

coords <- agCoords(single_map)

gmts <- gmt_single[match(rownames(coords), gmt_single$ag_name),]

for (j in seq_len(nrow(coords))) {
  data3js <- r3js::lines3js(
          data3js,
          x = rep(coords[j, 1], 2),
          y = rep(coords[j, 2], 2),
          z = c(0, gmts$logtiter[j]),
          col = "grey50",
          toggle = sprintf("GMT, %s", "Wu-1 infection"),
          geometry = TRUE,
          opacity = 0.7,
          lwd = 0.2 
        )
        
  data3js <- r3js::points3js(
          data3js,
          x         = coords[j, 1],
          y         = coords[j, 2],
          z         = gmts$logtiter[j],
          size      = 0.9,
          col  = "blue",
          toggle = sprintf("GMT, %s", "Wu-1 infection"),
          opacity   = 1 
          
        )
}


data3js
```


And the landscape like this:

```{r}
# Add GMT landscapes
data3js <- lndscp3d_surface(
      data3js = data3js,
      object = lndscp_fits$`Wu-1 infection`,
      crop2chull = FALSE,
      toggle = sprintf("GMT landscape, %s", "Wu-1 infection"),
      grid_spacing = 0.5,
      padding = 0.2,
      options = list(
        col.surface = "blue",
        opacity.surface = 1
      )
    )

data3js
```


We can change the landscape orientation (and select one by clicking on the "i" icon on the top right):

```{r}
# orientation for landscapes
angle <- list(
  rotation = c(-1.5141,0.0207,-0.6966),
  translation = c(0, 0.05,0.1), 
  zoom = 1.45
)

r3js::r3js(
  data3js,
  rotation = angle$rotation,
  zoom = angle$zoom
)
```

We packed all of the above in functions in the `code/helpful_functions/antibody_landscapes_functions.R` script, including options to style and label the base map, and plot individual serum antibody landscapes.

```{r}
source(file.path(here::here(), "code", "helpful_functions", "antibody_landscapes_functions.R"))

# plot the base map
data3js <-base_plot_data3js(map = single_map, 
                  lndscp_fits = lndscp_fits, 
                             highlighted_ags = agNames(single_map), # variants to highlight in the antigenic map
                             ag_plot_names = agNames(single_map), # variant names to plot
                             lims = lims)

set_r3js_orentation(data3js, angle)
```


Plot all serum group GMT landscapes together: 

```{r}
data3js_gmts <- plot_landscapes_from_list(data3js, # base object to add landscapes to
                                          lndscp_fits = lndscp_fits, # list of lndscp_fits, named with matching serum group
                                          map = single_map, # map for x,y coordinates of GMTs
                                          highlighted_ags = agNames(single_map), #
                                          lndscp_colors = lndscp_cols, # data frame containing the desired colours
                                          gmt_data = gmt_data %>%
                                            mutate(gmt = logtiter), # needs gmt column to take value from,
                                          show_gmts = TRUE # option to show or not show the GMT values
                                          )

set_r3js_orentation(data3js_gmts, angle)
```


We can also plot individual landscapes:

Plot all serum group GMT landscapes together: 

```{r}
data3js_idvl <- plot_landscapes_from_list(data3js, # base object to add landscapes to
                                          lndscp_fits = lndscp_fits[1], # list of lndscp_fits, named with matching serum group
                                          map = single_map, # map for x,y coordinates of GMTs
                                          highlighted_ags = agNames(single_map), #
                                          lndscp_colors = lndscp_cols, # data frame containing the desired colours
                                          gmt_data = gmt_data %>%
                                            mutate(gmt = logtiter) %>%
                                            filter(sr_group == names(lndscp_fits)[1]), # needs gmt column to take value from,
                                          show_gmts = FALSE, # option to show or not show the GMT values
                                          show.individual.surfaces = TRUE)

set_r3js_orentation(data3js_idvl, angle)
```

### Evaluating antibody landscape fits

An initial visual inspection whether the landscapes fit the measured GMT is a first indicator whether a (single cone) 
landscape fits the data. We can also examine the values in titer plot form:

```{r}
# helper function
comb_data <- combine_landscape_and_calculated_gmt(lndscp_fits, # named object with names matching the serum groups
                                                  gmt_data)


comb_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ag_name, y = logtiter, color = Data, group = Data)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylim(c(0, 9)) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = agNames(single_map),
                   name = "Antigen variant") +
  facet_wrap(~sr_group) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Below, we can look at how much the fitted and measured GMTs differ:

```{r}
comb_data %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Data, values_from = logtiter) %>%
  mutate(gmt_diff = `Fitted Landscape GMT` - `Calculated GMT`) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ag_name, y = gmt_diff)) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line(aes(group = sr_group)) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = agNames(single_map),
                   name = "Antigen variant") +
  facet_wrap(~sr_group) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(round(2^x, 2), "x"),
                     limits = c(-0.75, 0.75),
                     name = "GMT difference") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```


To evaluate the quality of landscape fits, we can compare the measured and fitted values. The error between measured value for each sera and fitted value for the GMT landscape is stored for each fit in the `residuals` field. They are on the log2 scale:

```{r}
lndscp_fits$`Wu-1 infection`$residuals
```

From them, we can calculate and compare the root mean squared error (RMSE) between individual serum titers and the fitted 
GMT landscape:

```{r}
# helper function to get residuals
residuals <- rmse_per_variant(lndscp_fits)


# plot residuals
residuals %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ag_name, y = rmse, fill = ag_name)) + 
  geom_point(color = "grey20", shape = 21) +

                   name = "Variant") +

  ylim(c(0,max(ceiling(residuals$rmse)))) +

```

We can also evaluate how much the individual landscapes differ from their fit:

```{r}
idvl_fitted <- lapply(names(lndscp_fits), function(x){
  residuals_to_long(return_idvl_fitted_value(lndscp_fits[[x]]), values_name = "logtiter") %>%
    mutate(sr_group = x)
})

idvl_fitted <- do.call(rbind, idvl_fitted) %>%
  mutate(Data = "Fitted") %>%
  mutate(sr_name = paste0(sr_name, "_", sr_group)) %>%
  rbind(., titer_long %>%
          filter(sr_facet != "GMT") %>%
          select(!sr_facet) %>%
          mutate(Data = "Simulated"))

idvl_fitted %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ag_name, y = logtiter, group = interaction(sr_name, Data), color = Data)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line(alpha = 0.4) + 
  ylim(c(0, 9)) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = agNames(single_map),
                   name = "Antigen variant") +
  facet_wrap(~sr_name) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```


```{r}
idvl_residuals <- lapply(names(lndscp_fits), function(x){
  residuals_to_long(calculate_idvl_residuals(lndscp_fits[[x]])) %>%
    mutate(sr_group = x)
})

idvl_residuals <- do.call(rbind, idvl_residuals)


idvl_residuals %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ag_name, y = residuals)) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") + 
  geom_line(aes(group = sr_name)) +

  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(round(2^x, 2), "x"),
                     limits = c(-0.75, 0.75),
                     name = "Titer Residuals") +

## Titer prediction

We can also fit landscapes on top of a map that contains more antigens than were measured 
in the landscapes sera. We can use the landscape to interpolate titers against unmeasured antigens. 
Such cross-validation can also be used to evaluate 
the quality of the landscape fit.

Below, we will demonstrate two approaches to interpolating titers against unmeasured antigens. The first one is including unmeasured 
antigens as "\*" in the titer table for each serum. To demonstrate, we select random antigens and set their titers to "\*" in the titertables 
for Wu-1 infected and Delta Breakthrough samples. We remove these antigens from the BA.1 reinfected titertables.

```{r}
# randomly select not measured ags
not_measured_ags <- c("BA.2.75", "JN.1", "BF.7", "XBB.1.5", "HV.1")
```

```{r}
titertables_sub <- titertables
titertables_sub[[1]][not_measured_ags,] <- "*"
titertables_sub[[2]][not_measured_ags,] <- "*"
titertables_sub[[3]] <- titertables_sub[[3]][-match(not_measured_ags, rownames(titertables_sub[[3]])),]

lndscp_fits_sub <- lapply(titertables_sub, function(titer_table){
  ablandscape.fit(
           titers = t(titer_table), 
           bandwidth = 1, # only important for loess fit
           degree = 1, # only important for loess fit
           method = "cone",
           error.sd = 1,
           acmap = single_map,
           control = list(
             optimise.cone.slope = TRUE,
             optimise.cone.coords = TRUE
           )
         )
  
})


slopes <- lapply(lndscp_fits_sub, function(x) x$cone$cone_slope)

slopes
```

The remaining antigens were enough to fit very similar slopes to the full data set. *Importantly, removing the Wu-1 
antigen would have a stronger impact as it sets the column basis for each serum*.

Let's compare the fitted landscape values:

```{r}
lapply(lndscp_fits_sub, function(x) x$fitted.values)
```

For the Wu-1 infected and Delta Breakthrough samples, titer values were fitted also for the not measured antigens that were present in 
the table but set to \*. When we excluded them, we do not get a fitted value. 

We can interpolate the landscape value at any coordinate in the following way:

```{r}
not_measured_coords <- agCoords(single_map)[not_measured_ags,]

predicted_vals <- ablandscapes:::predict.ablandscape.fit(lndscp_fits_sub$`BA.2 reinfection`,
                        not_measured_coords)
predicted_vals
```

You see that `NA` is returned for some antigens. That is because they are outside the convex hull of the landscape. As with any model (or assay), values outside the calibrated area are less reliable. It is still possible to interpolate them: 

$$cone\_height - ag\_dist \times cone\_slope$$

```{r}
predicted_vals["XBB.1.5"]<- mean(return_idvl_fitted_value(lndscp_fits_sub$`BA.2 reinfection`, target_coords = not_measured_coords["XBB.1.5",]))
predicted_vals["XBB.1.5"]
```

We can compare the fitted values from the complete fit with the interpolated values:

```{r}
fitted_vals_complete <- lapply(lndscp_fits, function(x) x$fitted.values)
fitted_vals_complete <- do.call(rbind, fitted_vals_complete) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "sr_group") %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = colnames(.)[2:ncol(.)], names_to = "ag_name", values_to = "logtiter") %>%
  mutate(Fit = "complete")

fitted_vals_sub <- lapply(lndscp_fits_sub, function(x) x$fitted.values)
fitted_vals_sub$`BA.2 reinfection` <- c(fitted_vals_sub$`BA.2 reinfection`, predicted_vals)
fitted_vals_sub$`BA.2 reinfection` <- fitted_vals_sub$`BA.2 reinfection`[names(fitted_vals_sub$`Wu-1 infection`)]
fitted_vals_sub <- do.call(rbind, fitted_vals_sub) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "sr_group") %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = colnames(.)[2:ncol(.)], names_to = "ag_name", values_to = "logtiter") %>%
  mutate(Fit = "interpolated")


comp_data <- rbind(fitted_vals_complete, fitted_vals_sub) %>%
  mutate(ag_in_fit = !(ag_name %in% not_measured_ags))

comp_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ag_name, y = logtiter, color = Fit, group = Fit, shape = ag_in_fit)) + 
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = 0.3)) + 
  scale_x_discrete(limits = agNames(single_map),
                   name = "Antigen variant") +
  facet_wrap(~sr_group) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

## Influenza antibody landscapes

Above, we were dealing with relatively simple scenarios of population immunity that could be modelled 
by a single cone. Influenza exposure histories are more complex. Unknown influenza infections and vaccinations 
over a longer time period and to more diverse strains result in immune landscapes that more closely resembles 
multiple hills and vallyes, rather than a single hill. Fonville et al. (DOI: 10.1126/science.1256427) modelled these 
using a loess function rather than a simple linear regression. 

Loess is short for locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The dataset is subset into parts and a local regression is 
fit to these smaller parts. The window of subset data moves across the dataset. In a weighted local regression (LOWESS), more weight is assigned to points closer to the center of the current window. The bandwidth (span) parameter determines 
the fraction of data used per window (higher span = larger fraction of data per window, larger smoothing). The local 
regressions can be polynomial functions of higher orders, the degree parameter specifies the degree of the polynomial.

plot(h3_map)
```
Above is the influenza H3 base map, coloured by antigenic cluster. We will put the flu landscape on top with the 
same parameters as used in the publication (bandwith = 11, degree = 1). You can look at the effect of changing both parameters in the example antibody landscape data from the paper by Fonville et al. (DOI: 10.1126/science.1256427).

The flu landscape fit and plot takes a bit 
longer to generate than the simple SARS-CoV-2 cone fit.

# Screenshotting Antibody Landscapes

To screenshot html objects we will use the [`htmlwidgets`](10.32614/CRAN.package.htmlwidgets) and [`chromote` package](https://rstudio.github.io/chromote/) so you need to have 
[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) installed on your computer. We will take the SARS-CoV-2 
landscapes as example.

```{r}
target_scp <- set_r3js_orentation(data3js_gmts, angle)

# need to temporarily save the landscape, create directory for it
file_path <- file.path(here::here(), "data", "landscapes")
dir.create(file_path)

# save html landscape widget
fig_path <- file.path(file_path, "landscape_screenshot.html")
saveWidget(target_scp, fig_path)

# open chrome session to screenshot html object
b <- chromote::ChromoteSession$new()
# supply path to figure
b$Page$navigate(paste0("file://", normalizePath(fig_path, winslash = "/")))

# wait before screenshot  
Sys.sleep(0.3)
